## Exercises in this lab

Now you're ready to complete the exercises in this lab. The lab includes multiple exercises, so when you finish one, just move onto the next one. The exercises in this lab are:

- Exercise 1: Run Locally and Explore Retrieval Modes
- Exercise 2: Enable Agentic Features

The exercises are designed to be completed in order because they build on the data and resources created in the previous exercises, so make sure you complete each exercise before moving on to the next one.

Don't worry if you run out of time to complete the entire lab. All of these exercises (and more) are available on [RAG Time](https://aka.ms/rag-time).
